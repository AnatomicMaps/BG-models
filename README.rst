Cardiovascular system model and flatmap
=======================================

This repository contains a preliminary bond-graph based model of the cardiovascular system encoded in CellML and the sources used to make a interactive flatmap version of the model for display on the SPARC portal flatmap viewer.

The repository is available on Github at https://github.com/AnatomicMaps/BG-models and in the Physiome Model Repository at https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/c3d.
